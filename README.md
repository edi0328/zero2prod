# Learning Backend Development in Rust

This repository documents my journey in learning **backend development with Rust**, guided by the book  
[**Zero To Production in Rust**](https://www.zero2prod.com/).  

The goal of this project is to **build a production-grade web service** while exploring the Rust ecosystem,  
modern backend practices, and tools for reliability and performance.

## What Iâ€™m Learning
- Fundamentals of **Rust for backend systems**
- **HTTP APIs** with [actix-web](https://actix.rs/)
- **Database access** with [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx)
- **Migrations** with [sqlx-cli](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/tree/main/sqlx-cli)
- **Testing** (integration & unit) in Rust
- **Error handling** and resilience patterns
- **Logging & observability** with [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing)
- **Continuous integration** with GitHub Actions
- **Deployment** to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) using Docker and automated pipelines
- **Transactional email delivery** via [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/)

## Tools & Dependencies
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest stable)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) for package management
- [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) for the web framework
- [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) for async database access
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization
- [Trunk / cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch) for live reload during development
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for hosting and deployment
- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) for reliable email delivery
